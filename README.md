# Identity Wheel Maker

This interactive Identity Wheel Maker is a React-based visualization tool that allows users to explore and represent their various social and cultural identities. Each identity is displayed as a slice of a pie chart, with:

* **Slice size** representing the importance of that identity to the user
* **Slice length** visualizing structural power or marginalization (longer = more power)
* **Clockwise/counterclockwise sorting** based on power and importance

Category labels appear at the outer edge of the wheel, with identity labels centered within each slice.

## Features

* Dynamic identity wheel rendered with Recharts
* Editable slices (click to update importance or identity)
* Preloaded identity categories organized by systemic power dynamics
* Power levels and importance visualized simultaneously
* Save/load locally and export chart as an image
* Customizable chart size and responsive layout

## Identity Categories

* Sex
* Sexuality
* Skin Color
* SES/Class
* Ability
* Age
* Body Size
* Citizenship
* Education
* Employment
* Family Status
* Gender
* Housing
* Indigeneity
* Language
* Literacy
* Location

All categories and identities are arranged from positions of systemic power (center) to marginalization (edge), and can be tailored to reflect user experience and context.

## About the Project

This tool was developed as part of CSL 688, a graduate seminar on cultural awareness and sensitivity in mental health counseling taught by Dr. Lucinda Bratini in Lynn University's Clinical Mental Health Counseling program. It is intended to support reflection on intersectionality, systemic power, and self-awareness in clinical training and beyond.
